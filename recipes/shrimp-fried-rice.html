    <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <li>In a medium bowl, mix the shrimp, cornstarch, salt and pepper. Let marinate at room temperature for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a large non-stick skillet on medium/high heat. When a bead of water sizzles and evaporates, swirl in 2 Tbsp of cooking oil and add shrimp to the hot skillet and spread them out in a single layer. Cook 1 minute per side, or until cooked through and opaque. Remove to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Over medium heat, add beaten eggs to the same skillet. Break up the eggs with a spatula and cook until no longer runny. Remove to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Wipe down the skillet with a paper towel and return to medium/high heat. Add 1 Tbsp oil and onions and cook green onions until fragrant, 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Stir in rice then spread it evenly over the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes without disturbing it then stir and saute another 1 to 2 minutes. Rice should sizzle.</li>
        <li>Drizzle 2 Tbsp soy sauce over rice and stir well. Add sesame oil and vegetables and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add cooked shrimp and cooked eggs back to the pan and mix well. Continue to cook until the rice is hot and sizzles, stirring frequently. Add more soy sauce to taste, if desired.</li>
